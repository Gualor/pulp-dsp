  Copies sample by sample from source vector to destination vector.
  <pre>
  pDst[n] = pSrc[n];   0 <= n < blockSize.
  </pre>
  There are separate functions for floating point, integer, and fixed point 32- 16- 8-bit data
  types. For lower precision integers (16- and 8-bit), functions exploiting SIMD instructions are
  provided.

  The naming scheme of the functions follows the following pattern (for example plp_dot_prod_i32s):
  <pre>
  \<pulp\> _ \<function name\> _ \<data type\> \<precision\> \<method\> _ \<isa extension\>, with

  data type = {f, i, q} respectively for floats, integers, fixed points

  precision = {32, 16, 8} bits

  method = {s, p} respectively meaning single core or parallel multicore implementation.

  isa extension = rv32im, xpulpv2, etc. of which rv32im is the most general one.

  </pre>
